PART 1. Simulations

The code in thsi folder reads the databases of tripartite networks and measure some structural features as well as their robustness to loss of plant species and interdependence between the robusness of the different itneraction layers, and sotre them in a database that is later used to perform the analyses (in the folder ANALYSIS) 

File 1_measure_empirical_EA.py reads the networks from the Network_DB folder, and simulates the removal of 3000 secuences of plant species, measuring the Robustness (1- Extinction Area) to loss of plants in one of these node removal scanarios: (RND), (OD), (ODinv) (random removal, by decreasing degree, by increasing degree). The robustness and interdependence results are stored in ../OUTPUT/Data/Ext_Area_"NET-NAME"_"EXTINCTION-SCENARIO".csv and the data we use to determine the ranking of importance of plants, that is the order of the plant in the sequence and the total robustness, in ../OUTPUT/Data/Ext_Areas/Node_impact_"NET-NAME"_"EXTINCTION-SCENARIO".csv
To execute the this code you need to specify one of the three extinction scenarios as an argument like this: 
python 1_measure_empirical_EA.py RND

File 1_measure_randomized_EA.py reads the networks, and performs 100 randomizations following one of the 4 random models: (NL), (NL2), (K2),or (K), and for each of the randomized networks measures the robustness and interdependence to the removal of 1000 sequences of plants in on of the three extinction scenarios: RND, OD, ODinv (random removal, by decreasing degree, by increasing degree). Resulta (average and standard deviation of robustness and interdependence) are stored in ../OUTPUT/Ext_Area_"NET-NAME"_"EXTINCTION-SCENARIO"_"NULL-MODEL".csv
To execute this code you need to provide both the null model and the extinction scenario as arguments like this:
python 1_measure_randomized_EA.py RND NL 

File 2_Create_Database_empirical.py reads the empirical networks in ../Networks_DB,  measures their structural features and read the robustness and interdependence generated by 1_measure_empirical_EA.py, combiing them and storing them in ../OUTPUT/Data/Networks_df_"EXTINCTION-SCENARIO".csv.
To execute the code you need to specify the extinction scenario as an argument like this:
python 2_Create_Database_empirical.py RND

File 2_Create_Database_randomizations.py reads the empirical networks in ../Networks_DB and performs 100 randomizations, measuring the average and standard deaviation of their structural features, and combining  it with the avreage and standaard deviation of robustness and interdependence generated by 1_measure_randomized_EA.py and storing the results in ../OUTPUT/Netwroks_rnd_df_"EXTINCTION-SCENARIO"_"NULL-MODEL"_"100"_av.csv (average values) and ../OUTPUT/Netwroks_rnd_df_"EXTINCTION-SCENARIO"_"NULL-MODEL"_"100"_std.csv (standard deviations)
To execute this code you need to provide both the null model and the extinction scenario as arguments like this:
python 1_measure_randomized_EA.py RND NL 

The rest of the files contain functions needed to perform the simulations.
