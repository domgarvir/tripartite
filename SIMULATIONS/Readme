Simulation code for studying tripartite ecological networks.

Basic functions and libraries are included in Mnetworks.py, functions for measuring different apstects of networks in Metrics.py and functions for the study of robustness in Robustness.py

These codes are aimed at obtaining the extinction are of empirical tripartite networks and of their randomized counterparts.

1- Obtaining the extinction areas

EMPIRICAL NETWORKS
To obtain the extinction area of the empirical networks in the data-set run:

python 1_measure_empirical_EA.py "extinction scenario"  

where "extinction escenario" must be one of these three: "RND" (for random extinction scenario), "OD" (Decreasing Overlap (i.e. total) degree) and "ODinv" (Increasing Overlap degree). The 3000 extinction areas of the different networks are stored in (../OUTPUT/Data/Ext_Areas/"network name"_"extinction scenario".csv)


RANDOMIZATIONS
Toobtain the extinction area of 100 randomizations of the empirical networks using any of the 4 null models run:

python 1_measure_randomized_EA.py "extinction scenario" "null model" 

where "extinction scenario" should be one of the 3 described above and "null model" should be one of the following 4: "NL", "NL2", "K2", and "K" . 

2- Creating database of extinction areas

After the extinction areas are obtained and stored, we are going to combine the resultsin one big database to facilitate the study of the results and the plotting of the figures:

EMPIRICAL NETWORKS:
To create the database of empirical networks extinction areas run:

python 2_Create_Database_empirical.py "extinction scenario" 

where "extinction scenario" should be one of these: "RND", "OD", "ODinv" (as before). 
The database containing the extinction areas for all empirical networks is stored in "../OUTPUT/Data/Networks_df_%s.csv" % ext_MODE (where ext_MODE in the "extinction scenario")

RANDOMIZD NETWORKS:

To create the database of the extinction areas of randomized networks run:

python 2_Create_Database_randomizations.py "extinction scenario" "null model"

where "extinction scenario" and "null model" can be the same as in the text above, and the databases contaning the extinction reas of the average values of the randomized networks are stored in "../OUTPUT/Data/Networks_rnd_df_%s_%s_%s_av.csv"  % (ext_MODE,null_model,Nrep) and the standard deviations in "../OUTPUT/Data/Networks_rnd_df_%s_%s_%s_std.csv" % (ext_MODE,null_model,Nrep)
