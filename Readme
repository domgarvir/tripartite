The Code used to study tripartite ecological networks is organized as follows:

PART 1: SIMULATION 
In this folder are the codes of the simulations used to study the structure of networks vs their randomizations and its robustness to the loss of plant species.
It reads the network files (/Networks_DB), runs, and output the extinction areas (/OUTPUT/Data/Ext_Areas) so different databases can be constructed (/OUTPUT/Data/Networks_df_*.csv) and studied in next part. It is not neccesary to perform the analysis, since the databases used in the study are provided in (/OUTPUT/Data/Networks_df_*) and in (/OUTPUT/Data/Ext_Areas/Node_impact_*)

PART 2: ANALYSIS
In this folder are the files used to study the output of the simulations (PART 1) and obtain the figures and tables shown in the manuscript and SI. 
It reads the network files (/Networks_DB) and robustness database (/OUTPUT/Data/Networks_df_*.csv) and output figures and tables (/OUTPUT/Images).

All codes are written on python (python 3.7) and uses the library pymnet http://www.mkivela.com/pymnet/

Further instructions are provided in each folder: PART 1 for simulations and PART2 for analysis of results.
