PART 2. Analysis

The Files FIGURE_2.py FIGURE_3.py and FIGURE_4.py perform the analyses presented in the main text and generate the Figures 2, 3 and 4, and table 1 in the main manuscript. 
All of them use the databases created in the firt part (SIMULATIONS) and stored in the ../OUTPUT/Data Folder, and export the figures and tables to ../OUTPUT/Images folder.

The rest of the files generate the analyses, figures and tables, included in the supplementary information. They also read the databases in ../OUTPUT/Data/Networks_df* and export 
the figures and tables to ../OUTPUT/Images folder. 

To execute the files no arguments are required, just execute in the console:
python "file_name".py
