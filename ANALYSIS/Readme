Codes for analysis the databases of extinction areas and structure of the tripartite networks. 

Basic functions required to work with tripartite networks are in Mnetworks.py, functions dealing with measurements on networks in Metrics.py and functions required to plot figures in Graphics.py.

Different files (named with the same name as the figure) generate the figures shown in the main text as well as in the SI.

To generate the figures just run:

python FIGURE_X.py 



FIG_S2_DH_and_Dcorr.py: study of degree distributions and correlations in tripartite networks
Generates Figure S2 and Table 1  

FIG_S3A_Node_properties_by_set: Study of degree distributions by species set.
Generates Figures S3 A and C, and saves the degree heterogeneity by species sets in empirical networks in the file in DH_by_sets_df_emp.csv  and the comparison with randomizations (nullmodel NL) in DHZSC_by_sets_df_NL_200.csv  (to avoid computing the randomizations each time the figure is generated).

FIG_S3B_layer_properties.py: Study of degree-degree correlations by interaction layer.
Generates FIGURES S3 B and D, and saves the degree-degree correlations by interaction layer in empirical networks in r_by_layers_df_emp.csv and the comparison with randomizations (null model K) in rZSC_by_layers_df_K_200.csv (to avoid computing the randomizations each time the figure is generated).

FIG_S5: Study of the structural features of connector nodes in empirical and randomized networks

FIG_S6: Study of interconnectance in empirical tripartite networks and z-score of interconnectance, in the 4 null models.

FIG_S7: Study of correlation between interdependence and different structural properties of the empirical tripartite networks

FIG S8: Study of the extinction are of the empirical tripartite networks in three extinction scenarios: RND (random species removal, covered in the main text), by Decreasing total degree (DD) and by increasing total degree (DD)

FIG S9: Study of the extinction area of empirical tripartite networks and zscore of the extinction area, in the 4 null models.

FIG S10: Study of the extinction area of tripartite networks as an estimation of the extinction area of the 2 bipartite networks composing it.

FIG S11 and S12: Study of correlation between extinction area and different structural properties of the tripartite ecological networks.
